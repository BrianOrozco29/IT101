	<p> <strong>Brian Orozco's Web Page</strong> </p>
	<p> Hello! My name is Brian Orozco and I am a third-year student at New Jersey Institute of Technology. Computer Science is my major of choice. I am currently taking IT 101, taught by Professor Lori Watrous-deVersterre. Other than that, I am also taking CS 288, CS 431, and MATH 333.</p>
	<p> My favorite pastimes include watching YouTube videos, browsing social media, and video editing. I also enjoy playing video games, both casually and competitively. My favorite video game franchises are Pokemon, Metal Gear, and Super Smash Bros. I currently work at Jersey Gardens mall as a Store Associate for a well-known sportswear brand. Thank you for visiting my homepage! </p>
